This is a counter-app built with React. So I created a custom counter hook with increment, decrement, reset, and setValue functions. I also implemented a page for the custom hook, 404, and a page to test the error boundary. This app has counter increment, decrement, reset, and set value functionalities. Please feel free to contribute.
