This is a counter App built with React. So I created a custom counter hook with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functionality. I also Implemented a page for the custom hook, 404, and a page to test error boundary. This app has counter increment, decrement, reset and set value functionalities. Please feel free to contribute.
